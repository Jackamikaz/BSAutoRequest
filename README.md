# BSAutoRequest
This program lets you request Beat Saber songs to yourself while you're not playing.

[![How to use](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3384575/110257739-74bcf400-7f9f-11eb-881d-ae90bb6890e3.png)](https://streamable.com/kmbzbq "How to use")

Type the BSR code in the text box, and check ChatRequests when you launch the game. You will see requests done by "Yourself".

It even works with a hotkey : just highlight a BSR code in any program, such as your navigator, or any copyable text, and press CTRL + SHIFT + F5.

It uses existing user files in the Beat Saber folder generated by ChatRequest, as such Beat Saber + needs to be installed and ChatRequest used at least once.

Thank you :
